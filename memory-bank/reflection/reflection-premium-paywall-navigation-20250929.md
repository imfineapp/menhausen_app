# Reflection: Premium Theme Paywall Navigation (2025-09-29)

## Overview
- **Objective**: Route users clicking on premium themes to a locked screen with an "Разблокировать" CTA, which leads to the purchase page.
- **Scope**: Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)
- **Components**: `ThemeWelcomeScreen`, `PaymentsScreen`, `HomeScreen`, `App.tsx`

## What Went Well
- **Reuse of Existing UI**: `ThemeWelcomeScreen` already supported `isPremiumTheme`, `userHasPremium`, and `onUnlock`, including localized "Разблокировать" text.
- **Minimal Code Changes**: Only adjusted click handling in `HomeScreen` and purchase completion routing in `App.tsx`.
- **Clear Navigation Flow**: After purchase, users are returned to the active theme context when applicable.
- **Quality**: ESLint clean, TypeScript no-emit success, unit tests 100% pass (212), E2E tests 100% pass (76).

## Challenges
- **Entitlement Source**: There is not yet a real entitlement check; currently relies on `userHasPremium` state.
- **Back Stack Semantics**: Ensuring post-purchase navigation resumes the intended theme without odd back stack artifacts.

## Lessons Learned
- **Design for Gating Early**: Building gating into welcome screens simplifies premium logic and minimizes conditionals across the app.
- **Localization First**: Reusing content keys (`themes.welcome.unlock`) keeps UI consistent and avoids hardcoding.

## Improvements / Next Steps
- **Real Entitlements**: Integrate entitlement retrieval (e.g., from API or Telegram payments webhook) to set `userHasPremium` reliably on app start.
- **Deep Linking**: Preserve and restore the exact theme/card context after purchase if initiated mid-flow.
- **Telemetry**: Add basic analytics for lock views and unlock clicks to measure funnel conversion.

## Verification
- **Lint**: Passed (`npm run lint`)
- **Types**: Passed (`npm run type-check`)
- **Unit Tests**: 212/212 passed (`npm run test:run`)
- **E2E Tests**: 76/76 passed (`npm run test:e2e`)

## Impact
- Users without Premium now see the proper locked messaging and can proceed to purchase seamlessly. Premium users proceed normally.
