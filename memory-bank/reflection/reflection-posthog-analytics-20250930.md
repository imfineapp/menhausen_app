# Task Reflection: PostHog Analytics Integration

## Summary
Implemented PostHog analytics with environment-based enablement and a reverse proxy setup. Ensured SDK initialization via provider, added safe wrappers, and updated CSP to allow the proxy domain so remote config and extension scripts load without violations.

## What Went Well
- Clear separation: provider in `main.tsx`, wrappers in `utils/analytics/posthog.ts`
- Robust guards: analytics disabled when env is missing or in test
- CSP alignment: dev meta, prod headers, and Vite dev headers updated consistently

## Challenges
- CSP violations when loading PostHog extensions through reverse proxy
- Determining exact sources required (`config.js`, `recorder.js`, autocapture, surveys, web-vitals)

## Lessons Learned
- PostHog may load additional scripts dynamically; CSP must include proxy in `script-src`
- Keep CSP in sync across dev/prod to avoid environment-specific regressions

## Process Improvements
- Document analytics host and CSP policy in the repo to streamline future changes
- Add a small QA checklist for analytics changes (Network verification, Console checks)

## Technical Improvements
- Centralize CSP strings to avoid drift (where feasible for the stack)
- Consider feature flag to toggle analytics extensions (surveys, recorder) if needed

## Next Steps
- Optionally add constants for event names to prevent taxonomy drift
- Monitor initial analytics flow and error rates after deploy
