# Archive: Premium Theme Paywall Navigation (2025-09-29)

## Summary
- Implemented premium gating: clicking a premium theme shows a locked screen with localized "Разблокировать" CTA that routes to purchase.
- Reused `ThemeWelcomeScreen` and `PaymentsScreen`; minimal code changes in `HomeScreen` and `App.tsx`.

## Key Changes
- `components/HomeScreen.tsx`: Always open theme on click; gating handled in `ThemeWelcomeScreen`.
- `App.tsx`: After purchase, return to current theme (`theme-home`) when applicable; otherwise go to profile.

## User Experience
- Non-premium users see lock message and can unlock via purchase flow.
- Premium users proceed directly to theme content.

## Quality Verification
- ESLint: Pass
- TypeScript: Pass (no-emit)
- Unit tests: 212/212 passed
- E2E tests: 76/76 passed

## Next Steps
- Integrate real entitlement source to set `userHasPremium` on app start.
- Consider deep linking back to exact theme/card context post-purchase.
- Add telemetry for lock views and unlock conversions.
