⏸️ Ready for Creative Phase - API Integration & Payment Flow Design

## Latest Changes
- **QA ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED**: Comprehensive quality assurance review performed
- **Project Knowledge Verified**: Confirmed understanding of entire codebase:
  - 24-screen navigation system with AppScreen type
  - 5-screen survey system with SurveyScreenTemplate
  - 47 ShadCN UI components fully integrated
  - Content management system with localization
  - React hooks + Context API state management
- **User Stories Added**: 6 comprehensive user stories across 3 epics:
  - Epic 1: Enhanced Data Persistence & API Integration (2 stories)
  - Epic 2: Premium Features Completion (2 stories) 
  - Epic 3: Analytics & Monitoring (2 stories)
- **Quality Gates Established**: Entry criteria, quality checks, and exit criteria for every phase
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed acceptance criteria for each user story
- **Quality Metrics**: Performance, security, privacy, and accessibility standards defined

## QA Assessment Results
**✅ WHOLE PROJECT UNDERSTANDING CONFIRMED**
- Current implementation scope fully mapped
- Architecture patterns documented and verified
- User journey flow completely understood
- Data flow from React state → localStorage → API endpoints traced
- Component structure and content management system verified

**✅ USER STORIES ALIGNMENT VERIFIED**
- All stories align with target audience (18-45, mental health support seekers)
- User journey matches specification requirements
- Business model (freemium with premium features) supported
- Mental health focus maintained throughout planning

**✅ QUALITY GATES COMPREHENSIVE**
- Entry criteria defined for each phase
- Quality checks include performance, security, privacy, accessibility
- Exit criteria with measurable standards
- Testing requirements specified (unit tests ≥95% coverage)
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI DSS) included

## Key Implementation Gaps Identified
1. **API integration layer** for data synchronization
2. **Payment gateway integration** for premium features (Telegram-compatible)
3. **Privacy-compliant analytics** implementation
4. **Enhanced offline-first data persistence** with conflict resolution

## Next Steps
- **REQUIRED**: Transition to CREATIVE MODE
- Design API integration architecture and data flow patterns
- Design payment subscription and premium unlock user experience
- Plan privacy-compliant analytics dashboard approach
- Design robust offline-first data persistence strategy with sync capabilities

## Creative Phases Required
This is a Level 3 task requiring multiple creative design decisions before implementation can proceed. All 4 creative phases have quality gates and acceptance criteria defined.

## Project State
- **Application**: Menhausen Telegram Mini App
- **Technology**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Current Status**: Core functionality complete, QA-enhanced plan ready for creative design
- **Architecture**: Component-based with centralized content system
- **Next Mode**: CREATIVE MODE (required for Level 3 complexity)
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive QA review completed with user stories and quality gates
