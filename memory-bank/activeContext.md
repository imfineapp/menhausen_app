## Status
‚úÖ Memory Bank directory structure created
‚úÖ Core Memory Bank files initialized
‚úÖ Project brief established
‚úÖ Technical context documented
‚úÖ Specification analysis completed
‚úÖ Task complexity determined: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)
‚úÖ Implementation priorities identified
‚úÖ QA assessment: Whole project understanding confirmed
‚úÖ User stories with acceptance criteria defined (6 stories across 3 epics)
‚úÖ Quality gates established for every development phase
‚úÖ CREATIVE PHASES COMPLETE: All 4 design decisions finalized
‚è∏Ô∏è Ready for VAN QA Technical Validation Before Implementation

## Latest Changes
- **ALL CREATIVE PHASES COMPLETED**: 4 comprehensive design documents created
- **API Integration Architecture**: Hybrid localStorage + REST with Simple Retry Queue selected
- **Payment Flow UX**: Telegram Payments API Integration designed with 3-step flow
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Hybrid First-Party + Privacy Service (Plausible) architecture
- **Data Persistence Strategy**: Hybrid localStorage + IndexedDB Strategy with conflict resolution
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Detailed TypeScript interfaces and class designs provided
- **Verification Checkpoints**: All design decisions validated against requirements
- **Technology Choices**: Platform-compatible solutions selected for Telegram WebApp context

## Creative Phase Results Summary
**üé® Design Decisions Made:**
1. **API Integration** (1-2 week implementation): Progressive enhancement of existing localStorage with retry queue
2. **Payment Flow** (1 week implementation): Native Telegram Payments API for optimal user experience
3. **Analytics** (2-3 week implementation): Privacy-first approach with therapeutic insights
4. **Data Persistence** (2-3 week implementation): Redundant storage strategy for zero data loss

**üîç Key Design Principles Applied:**
- **Telegram WebApp Compatibility**: All solutions work within platform limitations
- **Mental Health Context**: Privacy, trust, and therapeutic continuity prioritized
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Building on existing localStorage implementation
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **Privacy-Compliant**: GDPR compliance and mental health data protection

## Next Steps
- **REQUIRED**: Transition to VAN QA MODE for technical validation
- Validate all 4 design decisions against technical requirements
- Verify dependency compatibility and installation requirements
- Confirm build configuration and environment setup
- Test minimal implementation concepts
- Generate QA validation report before proceeding to implementation

## Creative Phases Documentation
All creative phases documented in memory-bank/creative/ directory:
- `creative-api-integration.md` - API service layer architecture
- `creative-payment-flow.md` - Payment UX and Telegram integration
- `creative-analytics-dashboard.md` - Privacy-compliant analytics system
- `creative-data-persistence.md` - Offline-first data strategy

## Project State
- **Application**: Menhausen Telegram Mini App
- **Technology**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Current Status**: Creative design phase complete, ready for technical validation
- **Architecture**: Component-based with centralized content system + 4 new architectural components
- **Next Mode**: VAN QA MODE (technical validation required before BUILD mode)
