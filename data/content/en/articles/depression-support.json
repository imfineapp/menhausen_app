Formulate a more balanced thought\n\n**Example:**\n- Thought: \"I'll never be able to do this\"\n- Distortion: Catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking\n- Balanced thought: \"This seems difficult now, but I can try breaking the task into steps\"\n\n### 6. Physical Health Care\n- Maintain sleep schedule (7-9 hours)\n- Eat balanced meals\n- Limit alcohol and caffeine\n- Spend time outdoors in natural light\n\n## When to Seek Professional Help\n\nSeek help immediately if:\n- You have thoughts of suicide or self-harm\n- Depression symptoms last more than two weeks\n- Depression interferes with your daily life, work, or relationships\n- You cannot cope with symptoms on your own\n\n## Types of Professional Help\n\n### Psychotherapy\n- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\n- Interpersonal therapy\n- Psychodynamic therapy\n\n### Medication\nAntidepressants can be effective for moderate and severe depression.
