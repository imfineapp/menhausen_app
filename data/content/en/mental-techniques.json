        "content": "The 4-7-8 technique activates the parasympathetic nervous system through controlled breathing. The increased breath hold raises carbon dioxide levels in the blood, signaling the brain to relax."

      {
        "title": "Why it's effective",
        "content": "The 4-7-8 ratio creates optimal balance between activation and relaxation. The 4-count inhale prepares the body, the 7-count hold allows oxygen absorption, and the 8-count exhale fully clears the lungs and calms the nervous system."

        "title": "Why it works",
