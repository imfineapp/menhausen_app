  "preambula": "We created this short test to help you understand where your inner support is now, and where tension may have accumulated.\n\nIt's based on proven psychological methods adapted to real male situations — without clinical labels or unnecessary philosophy.\n\nIt takes 5–7 minutes to complete, and the results will help select self-help cards that are right for you.",
  "instruction": "Answer honestly and spontaneously — there are no \"right\" answers here.\n\nIf you're not sure — choose what feels closer to your overall feelings, not to individual days.\n\nIt's better not to analyze, but to feel. Just assess how much the statement resembles your life right now.\n\nThere are about 30 questions, it will take 5–7 minutes.\n\nAt the end, you'll get an emotional map — we'll show which topics are most relevant now and suggest exercises that may help.\n\nThis is not a medical test, not a diagnosis, and not a label. It's a tool to better understand yourself and notice when you should give yourself a break.",
